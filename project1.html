Economic stress and the impact of the coronavirus have significantly reduced job availability and the loss of jobs for many individuals. A case like this presents an appropriate opportunity for scammers. Many people are falling prey to these scammers using the desperation that is caused by an unprecedented incident. Most scammer do this to get personal information from the person they are scamming. Personal information can contain address, bank account details, social security number etc. I am a university student, and I have received several such scam emails. The scammers provide users with a very lucrative job opportunity and later ask for money in return. Or they require investment from the job seeker with the promise of a job.
